   abstract = {Abstract Limited knowledge exists regarding the chronic effect of muscular exercise on muscle function in a murine model of severe Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD). Here we determined the effects of 1 month of voluntary wheel running (WR), 1 month of enforced treadmill running (TR) and 1 month of mechanical overloading resulting from the removal of the synergic muscles (OVL) in mice lacking both dystrophin and desmin (DKO). Additionally, we examined the effect of activin receptor administration (AR). DKO mice, displaying severe muscle weakness, atrophy and greater susceptibility to contraction-induced functional loss, were exercised or treated with AR at 1 month of age and in situ force production of lower leg muscle was measured at the age of 2 months. We found that TR and OVL increased absolute maximal force and the rate of force development of the plantaris muscle in DKO mice. In contrast, those of the tibialis anterior (TA) muscle remained unaffected by TR and WR. Furthermore, the effects of TR and OVL on plantaris muscle function in DKO mice closely resembled those in mdx mice, a less severe murine DMD model. AR also improved absolute maximal force and the rate of force development of the TA muscle in DKO mice. In conclusion, exercise training improved plantaris muscle weakness in severely affected dystrophic mice. Consequently, these preclinical results may contribute to fostering further investigations aimed at assessing the potential benefits of exercise for DMD patients, particularly resistance training involving a low number of intense muscle contractions. Key points Very little is known about the effects of exercise training in a murine model of severe Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD). One reason is that it is feared that chronic muscular exercise, particularly that involving intense muscle contractions, could exacerbate the disease. In DKO mice lacking both dystrophin and desmin, characterized by severe lower leg muscle weakness, atrophy and fragility in comparison to the less severe DMD mdx model, we found that enforced treadmill running improved absolute maximal force of the plantaris muscle, while that of tibialis anterior muscle remained unaffected by both enforced treadmill and voluntary wheel running. Furthermore, mechanical overloading, a non-physiological model of chronic resistance exercise, reversed plantaris muscle weakness. Consequently, our findings may have the potential to alleviate concerns and pave the way for exploring the prescription of endurance and resistance training as a viable therapeutic approach for the treatment of dystrophic patients. Additionally, such interventions may serve in mitigating the pathophysiological mechanisms induced by physical inactivity.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Greater diaphragm fatigue has been reported after hypoxic versus normoxic exercise, but whether this is due to increased ventilation and therefore work of breathing or reduced blood oxygenation per se remains unclear. Hence, we assessed the effect of different blood oxygenation level on isolated hyperpnoea-induced inspiratory and expiratory muscle fatigue. METHODS: Twelve healthy males performed three 15-min isocapnic hyperpnoea tests (85% of maximum voluntary ventilation with controlled breathing pattern) in normoxic, hypoxic (SpO2 = 80%) and hyperoxic (FiO2 = 0.60) conditions, in a random order. Before, immediately after and 30 min after hyperpnoea, transdiaphragmatic pressure (P(di,tw)) was measured during cervical magnetic stimulation to assess diaphragm contractility, and gastric pressure (P(ga,tw)) was measured during thoracic magnetic stimulation to assess abdominal muscle contractility. Two-way analysis of variance (time x condition) was used to compare hyperpnoea-induced respiratory muscle fatigue between conditions. RESULTS: Hypoxia enhanced hyperpnoea-induced P(di,tw) and P(ga,tw) reductions both immediately after hyperpnoea (P(di,tw) : normoxia -22 +/- 7% vs hypoxia -34 +/- 8% vs hyperoxia -21 +/- 8%; P(ga,tw) : normoxia -17 +/- 7% vs hypoxia -26 +/- 10% vs hyperoxia -16 +/- 11%; all P < 0.05) and after 30 min of recovery (P(di,tw) : normoxia -10 +/- 7% vs hypoxia -16 +/- 8% vs hyperoxia -8 +/- 7%; P(ga,tw) : normoxia -13 +/- 6% vs hypoxia -21 +/- 9% vs hyperoxia -12 +/- 12%; all P < 0.05). No significant difference in (di,tw) or P(ga,tw) reductions was observed between normoxic and hyperoxic conditions. Also, heart rate and blood lactate concentration during hyperpnoea were higher in hypoxia compared to normoxia and hyperoxia. CONCLUSIONS: These results demonstrate that hypoxia exacerbates both diaphragm and abdominal muscle fatigability. These results emphasize the potential role of respiratory muscle fatigue in exercise performance limitation under conditions coupling increased work of breathing and reduced O2 transport as during exercise in altitude or in hypoxemic patients.},

   abstract = {La diminution de la force et l'exacerbation de la fatigue neuromusculaire sont fortement impliquées dans l'altération des capacités fonctionnelles, de la tolérance à l'effort et du pronostic de patients porteurs de pathologies chroniques variées. Ces altérations peuvent trouver leurs origines dans des atteintes primaires de la fonction neuromusculaire et/ou des atteintes secondaires causées par exemple, par une diminution de l'activité spontanée favorisée par une pathologie chronique. Ainsi, la faiblesse et la fatigabilité musculaire sont des symptômes très fréquemment rapportés dans les maladies neuromusculaires (myopathies/neuropathies d'origine génétique ou acquise), les pathologies impliquant le système cardiovasculaire (insuffisance cardiaque) et/ou respiratoire (broncho-pneumopathie chronique obstructive (BPCO)). Ces symptômes sont aussi fréquemment associés aux syndromes idiopathiques de douleurs chroniques accompagnées d'anomalies de la nociception (syndrome fibromyalgique). Le développement d'outils d'évaluation bien tolérés et fiables de la force, de l'endurance et de la fatigue neuromusculaire est d'une importance cruciale pour approfondir la compréhension des mécanismes physiopathologiques et pour disposer de critères de jugement de qualité dans le cadre d'études observationnelles et interventionnelles. Dans ce contexte, la stimulation artificielle électrique s'est révélée être un outil performant pour évaluer in situ la fonction musculaire chez l'humain au repos et au cours de l'exercice. Plus spécifiquement, la stimulation magnétique des troncs nerveux périphériques a montré des prédispositions intéressantes pour l'évaluation de la fonction des muscles locomoteurs et respiratoires dans le cadre clinique. Au cours de ce travail, nous avons développé des outils d'évaluation de la force, de l'endurance et de la fatigue neuromusculaire en utilisant la neurostimulation magnétique et des protocoles d'exercice potentiellement applicables chez le patient. Nous avons étudié leurs capacités à détecter des différences liées au sexe, l'âge et au statut d'entrainement. Dans un second temps, nous avons appliqué nos évaluations dans le cadre de maladies neuromusculaires et de syndromes douloureux chroniques. Chez le patient BPCO, nous avons étudié les phénomènes de fatigue des muscles respiratoires et locomoteurs, leur impact sur la réponse à l'effort ainsi que leurs relations entre eux et avec les symptômes perçus. Chez ces patients, nous avons recherché les effets d'un entraiment d'une prise en charge combinant un entrainement des muscles locomoteurs et un entrainement des muscles respiratoires sur ces paramètres.},

   abstract = {Neuromuscular function can change under different conditions such as ageing, training/detraining, long-term spaceflight, environmental conditions (e.g. hypoxia, hyperthermia), disease, therapy/retraining programs and also with the appearance of fatigue. Neuromuscular fatigue can be defined as any decrease in maximal voluntary strength or power. There is no standardized method to induce fatigue and various protocols involving different contraction patterns (such as sustained or intermittent submaximal isometric or dynamic contractions on isokinetic or custom chairs) have been used. Probably due to lack of motivation/cooperation, results of fatigue resistance protocols are more variable in patients than in healthy subjects. Magnetic and electrical stimulation techniques allow non-invasive assessment of central and peripheral origins of fatigue. They also allow investigation of different types of muscle fatigue when combining various types of stimulation with force/surface EMG measurements. Since maximal electrical stimuli may be uncomfortable or even sometimes painful, several alternative methods have been recently proposed: submaximal muscle stimulation, low/high-frequency paired pulses instead of tetanic stimuli and the use of magnetic stimulation at the peripheral level.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To assess quadriceps strength and fatigability by using femoral nerve magnetic stimulation (FNMS) and their relationship to exercise capacity in patients with fibromyalgia syndrome (FMS) and healthy controls. METHODS: Twenty-two women (11 with FMS, 11 controls) performed a maximal incremental cycling test and a quadriceps fatigue test on 2 separate visits. For quadriceps assessment, we used FNMS during and after maximum voluntary contraction (MVC) to evaluate central and peripheral factors of neuromuscular fatigue. Subjects performed sets of 10 intermittent (5 seconds on/5 seconds off) isometric contractions starting at 10% MVC, in 10% MVC increments from one set to another until exhaustion. Neuromuscular fatigue was assessed with FNMS after each set. RESULTS: FMS patients had reduced initial MVC compared to controls (mean +/- SD 102 +/- 18 versus 120 +/- 24 Nm; P < 0.05) without significant impairment of voluntary activation (mean +/- SD 93.5% +/- 3.0% versus 93.1% +/- 3.4%; P = 0.74). During the fatigue task, FMS patients exhibited a greater fall in evoked muscular responses (mean +/- SD -26% +/- 6% versus -16% +/- 8% at set 50% MVC; P < 0.05), but not in MVC (mean +/- SD -24% +/- 7% versus -19% +/- 4% at set 50% MVC; P = 0.12). During the cycling test, FMS patients had lowered maximal exercise capacity and an enhanced rate of perceived exertion (RPE) compared to controls. The percent reduction in evoked muscular responses during the quadriceps fatigue test correlated with maximum oxygen consumption (r = 0.56, P < 0.05) and RPE at submaximal intensity (r = 0.84, P < 0.05) during cycling. CONCLUSION: Greater impairment in muscle contractility is associated with enhanced perception of exertion and reduced maximal exercise capacity in FMS patients. Neuromuscular impairments should be considered as an important factor underlying functional limitations in FMS patients.},

We used femoral nerve magnetic stimulation (FMNS) to distinguish central and peripheral factors of neuromuscular fatigue. We used a progressive incremental loading with multiple assessments to limit the influence of subject's cooperation and motivation. Twenty healthy subjects (10 men and 10 women) performed the test on two different days. Maximal voluntary strength and evoked quadriceps responses via FMNS were measured before, after each set of 10 submaximal isometric contractions (5-s on/5-s off; starting at 10% of maximal voluntary strength with 10% increments), immediately and 30min after task failure. The test induced progressive peripheral (41+/-13% reduction in single twitch at task failure) and central fatigue (3+/-7% reduction in voluntary activation at task failure). Good inter-day reliability was found for the total number of submaximal contractions achieved (i.e. endurance index: ICC=0.83), for reductions in maximal voluntary strength (ICC>0.81) and evoked muscular responses (i.e. fatigue index: ICC>0.85). Significant sex-differences were also detected. This test shows good reliability for strength, endurance and fatigability assessments. Further studies should be conducted to evaluate its feasibility and reliability in patients.},

   abstract = {Exercise intolerance in COPD seems to combine abnormal ventilatory mechanics, impaired O2 transport and skeletal muscle dysfunction. However their relative contribution and their influence on symptoms reported by patients remain to be clarified. In order to clarify the complex interaction between ventilatory and neuromuscular exercise limiting factors and symptoms, we evaluated respiratory muscles and quadriceps contractile fatigue, dynamic hyperinflation and symptoms induced by exhaustive high-intensity cycling in COPD patients. Fifteen gold II-III COPD patients (age = 67 +/- 6 yr; BMI = 26.6 +/- 4.2 kg.m(-2)) performed constant-load cycling test at 80% of their peak workload until exhaustion (9.3 +/- 2.4 min). Before exercise and at exhaustion, potentiated twitch quadriceps strength (Q(tw)), transdiaphragmatic (P(di,tw)) and gastric (P(ga,tw)) pressures were evoked by femoral nerve, cervical and thoracic magnetic stimulation, respectively. Changes in operational lung volumes during exercise were assessed via repetitive inspiratory capacity (IC) measurements. Dyspnoea and leg discomfort were measured on visual analog scale. At exhaustion, Q(tw) (-33 +/- 15%, >15% reduction observed in all patients but two) and Pdi,tw (-20 +/- 15%, >15% reduction in 6 patients) were significantly reduced (P<0.05) but not Pga,tw (-6 +/- 10%, >15% reduction in 3 patients). Percentage reduction in Q(tw) correlated with the percentage reduction in P(di,tw) (r = 0.66; P<0.05). Percentage reductions in P(di,tw) and P(ga,tw) negatively correlated with the reduction in IC at exhaustion (r = -0.56 and r = -0.62, respectively; P<0.05). Neither dyspnea nor leg discomfort correlated with the amount of muscle fatigue. In conclusion, high-intensity exercise induces quadriceps, diaphragm and less frequently abdominal contractile fatigue in this group of COPD patients. In addition, the rise in end-expiratory lung volume and diaphragm flattening associated with dynamic hyperinflation in COPD might limit the development of abdominal and diaphragm muscle fatigue. This study underlines that both respiratory and quadriceps fatigue should be considered to understand the complex interplay of factors leading to exercise intolerance in COPD patients.},

   abstract = {PURPOSE: The potential ergogenic effects of therapeutic inhaled salbutamol doses in endurance athletes have been controversially discussed for decades. We hypothesized that salbutamol inhalation may increase peripheral muscle contractility, reduce fatigability, and improve force recovery after a localized exercise in endurance athletes. METHODS: Eleven healthy, nonasthmatic male athletes with high aerobic capacities were recruited to be compared in a double-blinded, randomized crossover study of two dose levels of salbutamol (200 and 800 mug) and a placebo administered by inhalation before a quadriceps fatigue test. Subjects performed an incremental exercise protocol consisting in sets of 10 intermittent isometric contractions starting at 20% of maximum voluntary contraction (MVC) with 10% MVC increment until exhaustion. Femoral nerve magnetic stimulation was used during and after MVC to evaluate neuromuscular fatigue after each set, at task failure, and after 10 and 30 min of recovery. RESULTS: Initial MVC and evoked muscular responses were not modified with salbutamol (P > 0.05). The total number of submaximal contractions until task failure significantly differed between treatments (placebo, 72 +/- 7; 200 microg, 78 +/- 8; and 800 microg, 82 +/- 7; P < 0.01). MVC and evoked muscular responses were similarly reduced with all treatments during the fatiguing task (all P > 0.05). Voluntary activation was unaffected by the fatiguing task and treatments (P > 0.05). CONCLUSION: Supratherapeutic inhaled doses of beta2-agonists increased quadriceps endurance during an incremental and localized fatiguing task in healthy endurance-trained athletes without significant effect on neuromuscular fatigue. Further studies are needed to clarify the underlying mechanisms.},

   abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) is commonly used in critical care medicine to improve gas exchange. Altitude sickness is associated with exaggerated reduction in arterial oxygenation. We assessed the effect of PEEP and pursed lips breathing (PLB) on arterial and tissue oxygenation under normobaric and hypobaric hypoxic conditions. METHODS: Sixteen healthy volunteers were exposed to acute normobaric hypoxia (Laboratory study, FiO(2)=0.12). The protocol consisted in 3-min phases with PEEPs of 0, 5 or 10 cmH(2)O, PLB or similar ventilation than with PEEP-10, interspaced with 3-min phases of free breathing. Arterial (pulse oximetry) and quadriceps (near-infrared spectroscopy) oxygenation, ventilation, cardiac function, esophageal and gastric pressures and subjects' subjective perceptions were recorded continuously. In addition, the effect of PEEP on arterial oxygenation was tested at 4,350 m of altitude in 9 volunteers breathing for 20 min with PEEP-10 (Field study). RESULTS: During the laboratory study, PEEP-10 increased arterial and quadriceps oxygenation (arterial oxygen saturation +5.6+/-5.0% and quadriceps oxyhemoglobin +58+/-73 micromol.cm compared to free breathing; p<0.05). Conversely, PLB did not increase oxygenation. Oxygenation improvement with PEEP-10 was accompanied by an increase in expiratory esophageal and gastric pressures (esophageal pressure swing +5.4+/-3.2 cmH(2)O, p<0.05) but no change in minute ventilation, breathing pattern, end-tidal CO(2) or cardiac function (all p>0.05) compared to PEEP-0. During the field study, PEEP-10 increased arterial oxygen saturation by +6.7+/-6.0% after the 3(rd) minute with PEEP-10 without further significant increase until the 20(th) minute with PEEP-10. Subjects did not report any significant discomfort with PEEP. CONCLUSIONS: These data indicate that 10-cmH(2)O PEEP significantly improves arterial and muscle oxygenation under both normobaric and hypobaric hypoxic conditions in healthy subjects. PEEP-10 could be an attractive non-pharmacological tool to limit blood oxygen desaturation and possibly symptoms at altitude.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVES: To (i) evaluate the feasibility and the reliability of a test assessing quadriceps strength, endurance and fatigue in patients with fascioscapulohumeral dystrophy (FSHD) and Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease (CMT), (ii) compare quadriceps function between patients and healthy controls. METHODS: Controls performed the test once and patients twice on two separate visits. It involved progressive sets of 10 isometric contractions each followed by neuromuscular assessments with FNMS. RESULTS: Volitional assessment of muscle strength, endurance and fatigue appeared to be reliable in FSHD and CMT patients. Supramaximal FNMS was achieved in approximately 70% of FSHD patients and in no CMT patients. In FSHD patients, Femoral nerve magnetic stimulation (FNMS) provided reliable assessment of central (typical error as a coefficient of variation (CVTE)<8% for voluntary activation) and peripheral (CVTE<10% and intraclass coefficient correlation >0.85 for evoked responses) function. Patients and controls had similar reductions in evoked quadriceps responses, voluntary activation and similar endurance. CONCLUSIONS: This test provides reliable evaluation but FNMS exhibits limitations due to insufficient stimulation intensity particularly in neurogenic conditions. It showed similar central and peripheral quadriceps fatigability in patients and controls. SIGNIFICANCE: This test may be a valuable tool for patient follow-up although further development of magnetic stimulation devices is needed to extend its applicability.},

   abstract = {Rotator cuff (RC) disease is an extremely common condition associated with shoulder pain, reduced functional capacities, and impaired quality of life. It primarily involves alterations in tendon health and mechanical properties that can ultimately lead to tendon failure. RC tendon tears induce progressive muscle changes that have a negative impact on surgical reparability of the RC tendons and clinical outcomes. At the same time, a significant base of clinical data suggests a relatively weak relationship between RC integrity and clinical presentation, emphasizing the multifactorial aspects of RC disease. This review aims to summarize the potential contribution of peripheral, spinal, and supraspinal neural factors that may (1) exacerbate structural and functional muscle changes induced by tendon tear, (2) compromise the reversal of these changes during surgery and rehabilitation, (3) contribute to pain generation and persistence of pain, (4) impair shoulder function through reduced proprioception, kinematics, and muscle recruitment, and (5) help explain interindividual differences and response to treatment. Given the current clinical and scientific interest in peripheral nerve injury in the context of RC disease and surgery, we carefully reviewed this body of literature with a particular emphasis on suprascapular neuropathy that has generated a large number of studies in the past decade. Within this process, we highlight the gaps in current knowledge and suggest research avenues for scientists and clinicians.},

   abstract = {This study aimed to compare quadriceps function (i.e. strength, endurance, central, and peripheral fatigue) of young (Young-UnTr) and middle-aged (MidAge-UnTr) untrained men and young endurance-trained men (Young-Tr). Twenty-four male subjects (eight Young-UnTr (26 +/- 4 yr), eight Young-Tr (29 +/- 3 yr), and eight MidAge-UnTr (56 +/- 4 yr) performed a maximal cycling test to assess their fitness level. On a separate visit, subjects performed sets of 10 intermittent (5-s on/5-s off) isometric contractions starting at 10% maximum voluntary contraction (MVC), with 10% MVC increments from one set to another until exhaustion. Electrophysiological and mechanical (e.g. twitch) evoked responses elicited with magnetic femoral nerve stimulation in the relaxed muscle and during MVC (i.e. estimation of voluntary activation using the interpolated twitch technique) were measured at baseline and after each set to assess peripheral and central fatigue, respectively. Endurance (= total number of contractions) was also evaluated. Young-UnTr exhibited larger reductions in evoked quadriceps mechanical responses than MidAge-UnTr and Young-Tr after identical standardized muscle loading (e.g. after the 50% MVC set, reduction in single potentiated twitch was -36 +/- 9%, -21+/-16%, and -2 +/- 4%, respectively). At both 50% MVC set and exhaustion, MidAge-UnTr exhibited similar reduction in maximal voluntary activation and displayed similar endurance compared to Young-UnTr. Young-Tr exhibited greater endurance than Young-UnTr without significant changes in maximal voluntary activation throughout the test. This study provides robust comparative data regarding the influence of chronic exposure to endurance training and middle-aged on central and peripheral quadriceps fatigability and endurance. Endurance-trained subjects showed smaller level of peripheral fatigue and displayed no significant central fatigue, even at exhaustion and despite greater endurance performance. Our findings also demonstrate that men in the sixth decade exhibit significant alterations in quadriceps function typically observed in much older subjects. These data emphasize the need for developing normative data for both central and peripheral quadriceps fatigability.},

   abstract = {Supersonic shear imaging (SSI) is a recently developed technique for noninvasive assessment of tissue stiffness. In muscle, mechanical properties may be
affected by multiscale structural alterations induced by disease processes. However, muscle SSI data in patients with neuromuscular disorders are
particularly scarce. In this pilot study, we aimed to evaluate potential relationship between the severity of muscle weakness and passive muscle
stiffness in patients with inclusion body myositis (IBM). Twenty-three patients (61% men, age = 65.7 ± 8.9 years; BMI = 25.0 ± 3.9 kg·m−2; inclusion body
myositis weakness composite index = 62.5 ± 23.5) volunteered to participate in this study. Muscle shear modulus was assessed in the short head of the right biceps brachii with the elbow flexed at 80, 90, 110 and 170°. SSI was performed with an Aixplorer coupled with a SL 15-4 probe (Supersonic Imagine, Aix-en–Provence, France). Shear modulus measurements were measured before and after a conditioning of 5 cycles at 4°/s. Elbow flexion maximal voluntary isometric strength was assessed at 90° using an isokinetic dynamometer and expressed as percentage of predicted values. Shear modulus was 6.5 ± 1.1, 7.2 ± 1.4, 8.3 ± 1.8, and 20.6 ± 6.6 kPa at 80, 90, 110 and 170°, respectively. Muscle shear modulus was significantly increased at all angles (all P < 0.05) and no significant effect of conditioning was found (P = 0.51). Elbow flexion strength was 26.0 ± 12.9 Nm i.e. 50.4 ± 21.1% of predicted values. Shear modulus was linearly related to elbow flexion strength at all tested angles (R = 0.59; R = 0.77; R = 0.76; R = 0.56 at 80, 90, 110 and 170°, respectively;
all P < 0.001). In conclusion, lower passive muscle stiffness assessed by SSI was associated with more severe muscle weakness in patients with IBM. Further investigations including the quantification of muscle degenerating processes (e.g. fibrosis, fatty infiltration) are required to clarify mechanisms underlying these findings.},

   abstract = {This study evaluated gait using lower-trunk accelerometry and investigated relationships between gait abnormalities, postural instability, handgrip myotonia, and weakness in lower-limb and axial muscle groups commonly affected in myotonic dystrophy type 1 (DM1). Twenty-two patients (11 men, 11 women; age = 42 years (range: 26-51)) with DM1 and twenty healthy controls (9 men, 11 women; age = 44 years (range: 24-50)) participated in this study. Gait analysis using lower-trunk accelerometry was performed at self-selected walking pace. Postural stability was measured via center of pressure displacement analysis using a force platform during eyes-closed normal stance. Handgrip myotonia was quantified using force-relaxation curve modeling. Patients displayed lower walking speed, stride frequency, stride length, gait regularity, and gait symmetry. Strength of ankle plantar flexors, ankle dorsal flexors and neck flexors correlated with interstride regularity in the vertical direction (rho = 0.57, rho = 0.59, and rho = 0.44, respectively; all P < 0.05). Knee extension strength correlated with gait symmetry in the anteroposterior direction (rho = 0.45, P < 0.05). Center of pressure velocity was greater in patients and correlated with neck flexion and ankle plantar flexion weakness (rho = -0.51 and rho = -0.62, respectively; both P < 0.05), and with interstride regularity in the vertical direction (rho = -0.58, P < 0.05). No correlation was found between handgrip myotonia and any other variable studied. Lower-trunk accelerometry allows the characterization of gait pattern abnormalities in patients with DM1. Further studies are required to determine the relevance of systematic gait analysis using lower-trunk accelerometry for patient follow-up and intervention planning.},

   abstract = {Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) of the motor cortex during voluntary contractions elicits electrophysiological and mechanical responses in the target muscle. The effect of different TMS intensities on exercise-induced changes in TMS-elicited variables is unknown, impairing data interpretation. This study aimed to investigate TMS intensity effects on maximal voluntary activation (VATMS), motor-evoked potentials (MEPs), and silent periods (SPs) in the quadriceps muscles before, during, and after exhaustive isometric exercise. Eleven subjects performed sets of ten 5-s submaximal isometric quadriceps contractions at 40% of maximal voluntary contraction (MVC) strength until task failure. Three different TMS intensities (I100, I75, I50) eliciting MEPs of 53 +/- 6%, 38 +/- 5% and 25 +/- 3% of maximal compound action potential (Mmax) at 20% MVC were used. MEPs and SPs were assessed at both absolute (40% baseline MVC) and relative (50%, 75%, and 100% MVC) force levels. VATMS was assessed with I100 and I75. When measured at absolute force level, MEP/Mmax increased during exercise at I50, decreased at I100 and remained unchanged at I75. No TMS intensity effect was observed at relative force levels. At both absolute and relative force levels, SPs increased at I100 and remained stable at I75 and I50. VATMS assessed at I75 tended to be lower than at I100. TMS intensity affects exercise-induced changes in MEP/Mmax (only when measured at absolute force level), SPs, and VATMS. These results indicate a single TMS intensity assessing maximal voluntary activation and exercise-induced changes in corticomotoneuronal excitability/inhibition may be inappropriate.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Previous randomized controlled trials investigating exercise training programs in facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy (FSHD) patients are scarce and of short duration only. This study assessed the safety and efficacy of a 6-month home-based exercise training program on fitness, muscle, and motor function in FSHD patients. METHODS: Sixteen FSHD patients were randomly assigned to training (TG) and control (CG) groups (both n = 8) in a home-based exercise intervention. Training consisted of cycling 3 times weekly for 35 minutes (combination of strength, high-intensity interval, and low-intensity aerobic) at home for 24 weeks. Patients in CG also performed an identical training program (CTG) after 24 weeks. The primary outcome was change in peak oxygen uptake (VO2 peak) measured every 6 weeks. The principal secondary outcomes were maximal quadriceps strength (MVC) and local quadriceps endurance every 12 weeks. Other outcome measures included maximal aerobic power (MAP) and experienced fatigue every 6 weeks, 6-minute walking distance every 12 weeks, and muscle characteristics from vastus lateralis biopsies taken pre- and postintervention. RESULTS: The compliance rate was 91% in TG. Significant improvements with training were observed in the VO2 peak (+19%, P = 0.002) and MAP by week 6 and further to week 24. Muscle endurance, MVC, and 6-minute walking distance increased and experienced fatigue decreased. Muscle fiber cross-sectional area and citrate synthase activity increased by 34% (P = 0.008) and 46% (P = 0.003), respectively. Dystrophic pathophysiologic patterns were not exacerbated. Similar improvements were experienced by TG and CTG. CONCLUSIONS: A combined strength and interval cycling exercise-training program compatible with patients' daily professional and social activities leads to significant functional benefits without compromising muscle tissue.},

   abstract = {Rotator cuff (RC) tendon tears lead to negative structural and functional changes in the associated musculature. The structural features of muscle that predict function are termed "muscle architecture." Although the architectural features of "normal" rotator cuff muscles are known, they are poorly understood in the context of cuff pathology. The purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of tear and repair on RC muscle architecture. To this end thirty cadaveric shoulders were grouped into one of four categories based on tear magnitude: Intact, Full-thickness tear (FTT), Massive tear (MT), or Intervention if sutures or hardware were present, and key parameters of muscle architecture were measured. We found that muscle mass and fiber length decreased proportionally with tear size, with significant differences between all groups. Conversely, sarcomere number was reduced in both FTT and MT with no significant difference between these two groups, in large part because sarcomere length was significantly reduced in MT but not FTT. The loss of muscle mass in FTT is due, in part, to subtraction of serial sarcomeres, which may help preserve sarcomere length. This indicates that function in FTT may be impaired, but there is some remaining mechanical loading to maintain "normal" sarcomere length-tension relationships. However, the changes resulting from MT suggest more severe limitations in force-generating capacity because sarcomere length-tension relationships are no longer normal. The architectural deficits observed in MT muscles may indicate deeper deficiencies in muscle adaptability to length change, which could negatively impact RC function despite successful anatomical repair.

   abstract = {Background: Transdiaphragmatic pressure (Pdi) is the gold standard for the assessment diaphragm function. However, it is an indirect measure of diaphragm contractility. Muscle stiffness measured using ultrasound shear wave elastography (SWE) provides reliable estimates of force output in locomotor muscles. It is yet unknown whether SWE can be used in the diaphragm.Aim: To investigate the potential of SWE for gauging diaphragm contractility.Methods: 14 volunteers were studied during a stepwise inspiratory loading protocol from 0 to 50% of maximal inspiratory pressure during closed-airways maneuvers (Fig 1A) and during ventilation against external elastic loads (Fig 1B). Pdi was monitored and shear modulus of the diaphragm (SMdi) was measured over the right zone of apposition. Pearson correlation coefficient (r) and repeated measures correlation (R) were used to determine within-subject and overall relationships between Pdi and SMdi, respectively.Fig. 1: Typical recordings.Results: During closed-airways maneuvers, mean Pdi correlated to mean SMdi (r ranged from 0.77 to 0.96, all p<0.01; R=0.82, 95% CIs [0.77, 0.87], p<0.001). During ventilation against external loads, Pdi swing correlated to maximal SMdi (r ranged from 0.30 to 0.95, all p<0.01; R=0.69, 95% CIs [0.66, 0.73], p<0.001).Conclusions: SWE provides a new opportunity for non-invasive assessment of diaphragm contractility.FootnotesCite this article as: European Respiratory Journal 2018 52: Suppl. 62, PA3892.This is an ERS International Congress abstract.

   abstract = {Degenerative muscle changes may be associated with changes in muscle mechanical properties. Shear wave elastography (SWE) allows direct quantification of muscle shear modulus (MSM). The aim of this study was to evaluate the feasibility and reliability of SWE in the severely disordered muscle as observed in inclusion body myositis. To explore the clinical relevance of SWE, potential relationships between MSM values and level muscle impairments (weakness and ultrasound-derived muscle thickness and echo intensity) were investigated. SWE was performed in the biceps brachii at 100 degrees , 90 degrees , 70 degrees and 10 degrees elbow flexion in 34 patients with inclusion body myositis. MSM was assessed before and after five passive stretch-shortening cycles at 4 degrees /s from 70 degrees to 10 degrees elbow angle and after three maximal voluntary contractions to evaluate potential effects of muscle pre-conditioning. Intra-class correlation coefficients and standard errors of measurements were >0.83 and <1.74 kPa and >0.64 and <1.89 kPa for within- and between-day values, respectively. No significant effect of passive loading-unloading and maximal voluntary contractions was found (all p values >0.18). MSM correlated to predicted muscle strength (all Spearman correlation coefficients (rho) > 0.36; all p values < 0.05). A significant correlation was found between muscle echo intensity and muscle shear modulus at 70 degrees only (rho = 0.38, p <0.05). No correlation was found between muscle thickness and MSM (all rho values > 0.23 and all p values > 0.25, respectively). Within- and between-day reliability of muscle SWE was satisfactory and moderate, respectively. SWE shows promise for assessing changes in mechanical properties of the severely disordered muscle. Further investigations are required to clarify these findings and to refine their clinical value.},

   abstract = {This study introduces local pattern texture anisotropy as a novel parameter to differentiate healthy and disordered muscle and to gauge the severity of muscle impairments based on B-mode ultrasound images. Preliminary human results are also presented. A local pattern texture anisotropy index (TAI) was computed in one region of interest in the short head of the biceps brachii. The effects of gain settings and box sizes required for TAI computation were investigated. Between-day reliability was studied in patients with sporadic inclusion body myositis (n = 26). The ability of the TAI to discriminate dystrophic from healthy muscle was evaluated in patients with Duchenne muscular dystrophy and healthy controls (n = 16). TAI values were compared with a gray-scale index (GSI). TAI values were less influenced by gain settings than were GSI values. TAI had lower between-day variability (typical error = 2.3%) compared with GSI (typical error = 2.3% vs. 8.3%, respectively). Patients with Duchenne muscular dystrophy had lower TAIs than controls (0.76 +/- 0.06 vs. 0.87 +/- 0.03, respectively, p <0.05). At 40% gain, TAI values correlated with percentage predicted elbow flexor strength in inclusion body myositis (R = 0.63, p <0.001). The TAI may be a promising addition to other texture-based approaches for quantitative muscle ultrasound imaging.},

   abstract = {Background/Purpose: Wrist-worn accelerometers allow the objective estimation of physical activity (PA) in daily life. Recently, the ENMC workshop on outcome measures in myositis suggested to implement PA monitoring for improving patient follow-up. This study aimed to evaluate PA monitoring in the assessment of myositis patients in daily clinical practice.
Methods: Included patients had a diagnosis of dermatomyositis (DM), immune-mediated necrotizing myopathy (IMNM) or overlap myositis (OM). They either had a new-onset or relapsing myositis, a stable disease on maintenance therapy or were undergoing immunosuppressant tapering. Patients were evaluated at baseline and 6 months (M6). IMACS core-set measures, ACR/EULAR improvement score, muscle endurance testing, deltoid and psoas strength using hand-held dynamometry, 14-days raw acceleration data (expressed both as mean daily Euclidean norm minus 1 g (ENMO) and as standard deviations from healthy control Z-score), and quality of life (QoL) questionnaires were recorded. Relationships between variables were investigated using Spearman correlation coefficient (ρ) and random forest (RF) regressions.
Results: Fifty-five patients (16 OM, 27 IMNM and 12 DM) were included. At baseline, 67% had ENM0 Z-score lower than 1 (mean Z-scores −1.09±0.94). At M0, ENMO mainly correlated with manual muscle testing 8 (MMT8, ρ=0.44, p<0.001), creatinine level (ρ=0.43, p<0.001), HAQ (ρ=−0.53, p<0.0001), and SF-36-physical functioning (ρ=0.40, p<0.01). According to RF regressions, most important features associated with ENMO Z-scores were HAQ, SF-36-physical functioning/energy/pain and disease duration. At M6, ENMO changes mainly correlated to changes in muscle enzymes (ρ=−0.44, p<0.01), MMT8 (ρ=0.44, p<0.01), and depression score (ρ=−0.44, p=0.013). According to the RF regression, most important features associated with ENMO changes were absolute change in MMT8, HAQ, SF-36-physical functioning, physician global assessment, and depression score. ENMO changes were correlated with ACR/EULAR improvement score (ρ=0.48, p<0.01) and all patients, except one, achieving a major improvement had an absolute change of ENMO >5 mg/day. Yet, only 50% with moderate improvement (ACR/EULAR) had an improvement in ENMO and variable changes in ENMO were observed in patients with unchanged and minimally improved status.
Conclusion: PA levels were smaller in myositis patients at baseline compared to healthy controls and were correlated with MMT8 and QoL. Patients with major ACR/EULAR improvements at follow-up were associated with consistent changes in PA, while other displayed heterogeneous changes in PA.},

   abstract = {Introduction Les accéléromètres de poignet permettent une mesure objective de l’activité physique dans la vie quotidienne. Récemment, l’ENMC (European Neuromuscular Center) a recommandé d’implanter dans l’évaluation clinique courante l’activité physique pour améliorer le suivi des patients atteints de myopathies auto-immunes L’objectif était donc de mesurer et d’évaluer les changements de l’activité physique dans l’évaluation des patients avec myosite. Matériels et méthodes Tous les patients inclus présentaient un diagnostic de dermatomyosite (DM), de myopathie nécrosante auto-immunes (MNAI) ou de myosite de chevauchement (MC). Les patients pouvaient être naïfs de traitement ou en rechute, être en rémission, ou être en cours de sevrage des traitements immunosuppresseurs. Les patients ont eu une évaluation initiale (M0) puis à 6 mois (M6). Les paramètres d’évaluation IMACS (International Myositis Assessment & Clinical Studies Group), le score d’amélioration ACR/EULAR, des mesures d’endurance musculaire, la mesure quantitative de la force du deltoide et du psoas en dynamométrie portative, l’enregistrement sur 14jours des données d’accélération exprimées en moyenne quotidienne Euclidean norm minus 1g (ENMO) et en écart-type de sujets sains contrôles (score-Z), et des questionnaires de qualité de vie ont été réalisés. Des relations entre les variables ont été évaluées à l’aide du coefficient de corrélation Spearman (ρ) et des régressions de Random forest (RF). Résultats Cinquante-cinq patients (16 MC, 27 MNAI et 12 DM) ont été inclus. Lors de l’évaluation initiale (M0), 67 % des patients avaient un score Z ENMO inférieur à 1 (moyenne scores-Z −1,09±0,94). À M0, l’ENMO était corrélé principalement avec le testing musculaire manuel 8 (MMT8, ρ=0,44, p<0,001), la créatinine (ρ=0,43, p<0,001), le HAQ (ρ=−0,53, p<0,0001), et le SF-36-fonctionnement physique (ρ=0,40, p<0,01). Selon les analyses de régressions RF, les variables principalement associées avec le score-Z ENMO étaient le HAQ, le SF-36-fonctionnement physique/énergie/douleur et la durée de la maladie. À M6, les changements en ENMO étaient principalement corrélés avec le changement des enzymes musculaires (ρ=−0,44, p<0,01), le MMT8 (ρ=0,44, p<0,01), et le score de dépression (ρ=−0,44, p=0,013). Selon les analyses de régressions RF, les variables principalement associées à un changement d’ENMO étaient le MMT8, HAQ, SF-36-fonctionnement physique, l’évaluation globale du médecin, et le score de dépression. Les changements d’ENMO étaient corrélés avec l’amélioration du score ACR/EULAR (ρ=0.48, p<0,01) et tous les patients, sauf un, ayant atteint une amélioration majeure ont présenté un changement absolu d’ENMO >5 mg/jour. Néanmoins, seul 50 % des patients ayant présentés une amélioration modérée du score ACR/EULAR ont également présenté une amélioration en ENMO, et des changements variables en ENMO ont été observés chez les patients présentant un statut inchangé à minimalement amélioré. Conclusion Le niveau d’activité physique est plus faible chez les patients atteints de myopathies auto-immunes et sont corrélés avec le MMT8 et la qualité de vie. Une amélioration majeure du score ACR/EULAR à M6 était associée avec des changements substantiels du niveau d’activité physique, alors que ce dernier était plus variable chez les autres patients.},

During all tasks, Pdi was measured and SWE was used to assess shear modulus of the right hemidiaphragm (SMdi) at the zone of apposition. Pearson correlation coefficients ( r) and repeated-measures correlation coefficients ( R) were computed to determine within-individual and overall relationships between Pdi and SMdi, respectively. During closed-airways maneuvers, mean Pdi correlated to mean SMdi in all participants [ r ranged from 0.77 to 0.96, all P < 0.01; R = 0.82, 95% confidence intervals (0.76, 0.86), P < 0.01]. During ventilation against inspiratory threshold loading, Pdi swing correlated to maximal SMdi in all participants [ r ranged from 0.40 to 0.90, all P < 0.01; R = 0.70, 95% confidence intervals (0.66, 0.73), P < 0.001]. Changes in diaphragm stiffness as assessed by SWE reflect changes in transdiaphragmatic pressure. SWE provides a new opportunity for direct and noninvasive assessment of diaphragm function. NEW & NOTEWORTHY Accurate and specific estimation of diaphragm effort is critical for evaluating and monitoring diaphragm dysfunction. The measurement of transdiaphragmatic pressure requires the use of invasive gastric and esophageal probes. In the present work, we demonstrate that changes in diaphragm stiffness assessed with ultrasound shear wave elastography reflect changes in transdiaphragmatic pressure, therefore offering a new noninvasive method for gauging diaphragm effort.},

   abstract = {This study aimed to evaluate physical activity (PA) monitoring using wrist-worn accelerometers in the assessment of myositis patients. Included patients had a diagnosis of dermatomyositis (DM), immune-mediated necrotizing myopathy (IMNM) or overlap myositis (OM) and were evaluated at baseline (M0) and 6 months (M6). IMACS core-set measures, ACR/EULAR improvement score, muscle endurance testing, 14-days raw acceleration data (expressed both as mean daily Euclidean norm minus 1 g (ENMO)), and quality of life questionnaires were recorded. Relationships between variables were investigated using Spearman correlation coefficient (ρ) and random forest (RF) regressions. Fifty-five patients (16 OM, 27 IMNM and 12 DM) were included. At M0, ENMO mainly correlated with manual muscle testing 8 (MMT8, ρ=0.44, p=0.001), creatinine level (ρ=0.43, p=0.001), HAQ (ρ=−0.53, p<0.001), and SF-36-physical functioning (ρ=0.40, p=0.002). According to RF regressions, most important features associated with ENMO Z-scores were HAQ, SF-36-physical functioning/energy/pain and disease duration. At M6, ENMO changes mainly correlated with changes in depression score (ρ=−0.57, p=0.001), HAQ (ρ=−0.51, p<0.001), and SF-36-energy/fatigue (ρ=0.51, p<0.001). According to the RF regression, most important features associated with ENMO changes were change in MMT8, HAQ, SF-36-physical functioning, physician global assessment, and depression score. Changes in ENMO were correlated with ACR/EULAR improvement score (ρ=0.57, p<0.01) and all patients, except one, achieving a major improvement at M6 had a significant ENMO change. Yet, variable changes in ENMO were observed in patients with minimal to moderate improvement at M6. PA levels were correlated with muscle strength and function, while PA change was also associated with emotional change. Only patients with major ACR/EULAR improvements at follow-up were associated with consistent changes in PA.},

   abstract = {Introduction: Mechanical ventilation is a life-saving treatment that is however associated with diaphragm dysfunction. The optimal ventilator settings providing a lung protective ventilation while maintaining a safe diaphragm activity are difficult to determine. A noninvasive and bedside evaluation of the diaphragm activity could be helpful. We investigated whether changes in diaphragm stiffness (ΔSMdi) assessed using ultrasound shear wave elastography (SWE) may be used as a surrogate of changes in transdiaphragmatic pressure (ΔPdi) in mechanically ventilated (MV) patients.Methods: Pdi was continuously monitored using esophageal and gastric balloons and SMdi was measured at the zone of apposition of the right hemi-diaphragm. Measurements were performed twice under initial ventilator settings and every five minutes during a spontaneous breathing trial (SBT). Pearson correlation coefficient (r) were used to determine within-individual and overall relationships between Pdi and SMdi.Results: Among the 25 patients enrolled, 8 displayed a significant ΔSMdi-ΔPdi correlation (r=0.62-0.88, p<0.05). Compared to others, patients with significant correlations had a lower respiratory rate (16±5 vs 24±6 breath/min, respectively; p<0.01) and a significant increase in ΔSMdi between initial ventilator settings and the SBT. Patients without ΔSMdi-ΔPdi correlation only had an increase in ΔPdi during the SBT with no concomitant increase in ΔSMdi.Conclusion: SMdi obtained by SWE appears as a promising technique to assess diaphragm activity in MV patients. Technological improvements are necessary to increase SWE sampling rate before enabling its generalization in the ICU.FootnotesCite this article as: ERJ Open Research 2020; 6: Suppl. 4, 19.This is an ERS Respiratory Failure and Mechanical Ventilation Conference abstract.

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Diaphragm dysfunction is highly prevalent in mechanically ventilated patients. Recent work showed that changes in diaphragm shear modulus (DeltaSMdi) assessed using ultrasound shear wave elastography (SWE) are strongly related to changes in Pdi (DeltaPdi) in healthy subjects. The aims of this study were to investigate the relationship between DeltaSMdi and DeltaPdi in mechanically ventilated patients, and whether DeltaSMdi is responsive to change in respiratory load when varying the ventilator settings. METHODS: A prospective, monocentric study was conducted in a 15-bed ICU. Patients were included if they met the readiness-to-wean criteria. Pdi was continuously monitored using a double-balloon feeding catheter orally introduced. The zone of apposition of the right hemidiaphragm was imaged using a linear transducer (SL10-2, Aixplorer, Supersonic Imagine, France). Ultrasound recordings were performed under various pressure support settings and during a spontaneous breathing trial (SBT). A breath-by-breath analysis was performed, allowing the direct comparison between DeltaPdi and DeltaSMdi. Pearson's correlation coefficients (r) were used to investigate within-individual relationships between variables, and repeated measure correlations (R) were used for determining overall relationships between variables. Linear mixed models were used to compare breathing indices across the conditions of ventilation. RESULTS: Thirty patients were included and 930 respiratory cycles were analyzed. Twenty-five were considered for the analysis. A significant correlation was found between DeltaPdi and DeltaSMdi (R = 0.45, 95% CIs [0.35 0.54], p < 0.001). Individual correlation displays a significant correlation in 8 patients out of 25 (r = 0.55-0.86, all p < 0.05, versus r = - 0.43-0.52, all p > 0.06). Changing the condition of ventilation similarly affected DeltaPdi and DeltaSMdi. Patients in which DeltaPdi-DeltaSMdi correlation was non-significant had a faster respiratory rate as compared to that of patient with a significant DeltaPdi-DeltaSMdi relationship (median (Q1-Q3), 25 (18-33) vs. 21 (15-26) breaths.min(-1), respectively). CONCLUSIONS: We demonstrate that ultrasound SWE may be a promising surrogate to Pdi in mechanically ventilated patients. Respiratory rate appears to negatively impact SMdi measurement. Technological developments are needed to generalize this method in tachypneic patients. TRIAL REGISTRATION: NCT03832231 .},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Muscle strength is a critical clinical hallmark in both health and disease. The current study introduces a novel portable device prototype (MyoQuad) for assessing and monitoring maximal voluntary isometric knee extension torque (MVIT). APPROACH: Fifty-six patients with inclusion body myositis were studied. Knee extension weakness is a key feature in this inflammatory muscle disease. Cross-validation with an isokinetic dynamometer (Biodex System 3 Pro) was performed. Between-day reproducibility and ability to monitor changes in muscle strength over time compared to the gold standard method as a reference, were also investigated. MAIN RESULTS: The measurement was feasible even in the weakest patients. Agreement between methods was excellent (standard error of measurement (SEM) was 3.8 Nm and intra-class correlation coefficient (ICC) was 0.973). Least significant difference (LSD) was 4.9 and 5.3 Nm for the MyoQuad and the Biodex, respectively Measurements using the MyoQuad exhibited excellent between-day reproducibility (SEM was 2.4 Nm and ICC was 0.989 versus 2.6 Nm and 0.988 using the Biodex). Changes in MVIT at 6 and 12 months were similar between methods (timepoint x method interaction was not significant; all p > 0.19); strength changes classified according to LSD at 6 and 12 months were consistent between methods (>70% consistent classification)). SIGNIFICANCE: The measurement of MVIT using the MyoQuad offers a cost-effective, portable and immediate alternative for the routine measurement of maximal voluntary isometric strength of the quadriceps. The MyoQuad offers a comfort and stability that cannot be provided by standard hand-held dynamometers. These results support quantitative muscle strength assessment using fixed yet flexible dynamometry within clinical routine and multicenter trials.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to investigate the relationship between changes in clinical status on daily life physical activity (PA) in patients with idiopathic inflammatory myopathy (IIM). METHODS: Patients with dermatomyositis (DM), immune-mediated necrotizing myopathy (IMNM) or overlap myositis (OM) who presented either a new-onset or relapsing IIM, stable disease on maintenance therapy or were undergoing immunosuppressant tapering were included. Patients were evaluated at inclusion (V0), and at two follow-up visits (V1, 94+/-12 days from V0; V2, 96+/-17 days from V1). The American College of Rheumatology/European League against Rheumatism (ACR/EULAR) response criteria was recorded. PA assessed using 14-days raw accelerometry data gathered using a wrist-worn accelerometer after each visit (mean daily Euclidean norm minus 1 g (ENMO) was computed). RESULTS: Fifty-five patients (16 OM, 27 IMNM and 12 DM) were included. At baseline, 67% of patients had an ENMO Z-score less than 1. At inclusion, ENMO mainly correlated with health assessment questionnaire score (HAQ, rho=-0.51, p<0.01), manual muscle testing 8 (MMT8, rho=0.42, p<0.01), creatinine level (rho=0.41, p<0.01), and SF-36 physical functioning score (rho=0.38, p<0.002). At follow-up, ENMO changes mainly correlated with changes in MMT8, HAQ, SF-36 fatigue, and depression score (all rho>0.43, all p<0.001). Level of agreement between ACR/EULAR response criteria and changes in PA was 15, 45, and 90% for minimal (n = 13), moderate (n = 20), and major (n = 10) improvements, respectively. CONCLUSION: Baseline PA levels and change in PA correlated with muscle strength and function, yet changes in PA were also influenced by psychological status. Only patients with major improvements on the ACR/EULAR criteria had significant increase in PA. Accelerometer may serve as an objective tool to define a clinically relevant real-life outcome.},

Here we test how maximal diaphragm tissue velocity (Vdimax) is related to stimulation intensity and Pditw, during CMS. Ultrafast ultrasound of the diaphragm was performed in 13 healthy subjects at various intensity levels. We show that Vdimax is strongly related to stimulation intensity and Pditw, in all participants. Within-day reliability for Vdimax was strong and similar to that of Pditw. Our findings open prospects for the non-invasive monitoring of Pditw in clinical populations. Indeed, the relative changes in Pditw over time may be monitored by assessing the relative changes in Vdimax.},

   abstract = {KEY POINTS: Twitch transdiaphragmatic pressure elicited by cervical magnetic stimulation of the phrenic nerves is a fully non-volitional method for assessing diaphragm contractility in humans, yet it requires invasive procedures such as oesophageal and gastric catheter balloons. Ultrafast ultrasound enables a very high frame rate allowing the capture of transient events, such as muscle contraction elicited by nerve stimulation (twitch). Whether indices derived from ultrafast ultrasound can be used as an alternative to the invasive measurement of twitch transdiaphragmatic pressure is unknown. Our findings demonstrate that maximal diaphragm tissue velocity assessed using ultrafast ultrasound following cervical magnetic stimulation is reliable, sensitive to change in cervical magnetic stimulation intensity, and correlates to twitch transdiaphragmatic pressure. This approach provides a novel fully non-invasive and non-volitional tool for the assessment of diaphragm contractility in humans. ABSTRACT: Measuring twitch transdiaphragmatic pressure (P(di,tw) ) elicited by cervical magnetic stimulation (CMS) is considered as a reference method for the standardized evaluation of diaphragm function. Yet, the measurement of P(di) requires invasive oesophageal and gastric catheter-balloons. Ultrafast ultrasound is a non-invasive imaging technique enabling frame rates high enough to capture transient events such as evoked muscle contractions. This study investigated relationships between indices derived from ultrafast ultrasound and P(di,tw) , and how these indices might be used to estimate P(di,tw) . CMS was performed in 13 healthy volunteers from 30% to 100% of maximal stimulator intensity in units of 10% in a randomized order. P(di,tw) was measured and the right hemidiaphragm was imaged using a custom ultrafast ultrasound sequence with 1 kHz framerate. Maximal diaphragm axial velocity (V(di) ,(max) ) and diaphragm thickening fraction (TF(di,tw) ) were computed. Intra-session reliability was assessed. Repeated-measures correlation (R) and Spearman correlation coefficients (rho) were used to assess relationships between variables. Intra-session reliability was strong for P(di,tw) and V(di,max) and moderate for TF(di,tw) . V(di,max) correlated with P(di,tw) in all subjects (0.64 < rho < 1.00, R = 0.75; all P < 0.05). TF(di,tw) correlated with P(di,tw) in eight subjects only (0.85 < rho < 0.93, R = 0.69; all P < 0.05). Coupling ultrafast ultrasound and CMS shows promise for the non-invasive and fully non-volitional assessment of diaphragm contractility. This approach opens up the prospect of both diagnosis and follow-up of diaphragm contractility in clinical populations.},

   abstract = {Introduction: Diaphragm thickening fraction (TFdi) measured by ultrasound is widely used to evaluate diaphragm function to optimize ventilator support and weaning. TFdi cut-off values that could help in predicting weaning outcome have been reported. However, data regarding the relationship between TFdi and the changes in transdiaphragmatic pressure (ΔPdi) are lacking.Aims: We explored ΔPdi-TFdi relationship in healthy and mechanically ventilated (MV) subjects.Methods: Pdi was monitored and the right hemidiaphragm was imaged. Healthy subjects breathed against an external inspiratory load at 0-50% of maximal inspiratory pressure. MV patients were tested under several ventilator assistance levels and during a spontaneous breathing trial. A breath-by-breath analysis was performed. Pearson correlation coefficients (r) were used to determine within-individual ΔPdi-TFdi relationship.Results: Fifteen healthy volunteers and 22 MV patients were studied. Significant ΔPdi-TFdi correlation (r=0.32, p<0.01) was observed in 1 healthy subject only and in 3 MV patients (r=0.67, 95% CIs [0.41,0.83] in patients with significant ΔPdi-TFdi correlation, all p<0.05). Overall, relationship between ΔPdi and TFdi was absent in healthy subjects (R= -0.08, 95% CIs [-0.33,0.18], p=0.53) and weak in MV patients (R=0.17, 95% CIs [0.04,0.29], p<0.05).Conclusions: Unlike previous works investigating between-subject correlation, this study used breath-by-breath and within-subject correlation analyses to investigate ΔPdi-TFdi relationships. Our findings suggest that TFdi may not be considered as a surrogate of Pdi.FootnotesCite this article as: ERJ Open Research 2020; 6: Suppl. 4, 14.This is an ERS Respiratory Failure and Mechanical Ventilation Conference abstract.

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: The availability of non-invasive, accessible, and reliable methods for estimating regional skeletal muscle volume is paramount in conditions involving primary and/or secondary muscle wasting. This work aimed at (i) optimizing serial bioelectrical impedance analysis (S(BIA) ) by computing a conductivity constant based on quantitative magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data and (ii) investigating the potential of S(BIA) for estimating lean regional thigh muscle volume in patients with severe muscle disorders. METHODS: Twenty healthy participants with variable body mass index and 20 patients with idiopathic inflammatory myopathies underwent quantitative MRI. Anatomical images and fat fraction maps were acquired in thighs. After manual muscle segmentation, lean thigh muscle volume (lV(MRI) ) was computed. Subsequently, multifrequency (50 to 350 kHz) serial resistance profiles were acquired between current skin electrodes (i.e. ankle and hand) and voltage electrodes placed on the anterior thigh. In vivo values of the muscle electrical conductivity constant were computed using data from S(BIA) and MRI gathered in the right thigh of 10 healthy participants. Lean muscle volume (lV(BIA) ) was derived from S(BIA) measurements using this newly computed constant. Between-day reproducibility of lV(BIA) was studied in six healthy participants. RESULTS: Electrical conductivity constant values ranged from 0.82 S/m at 50 kHz to 1.16 S/m at 350 kHz. The absolute percentage difference between lV(BIA) and lV(MRI) was greater at frequencies >270 kHz (P < 0.0001). The standard error of measurement and the intra-class correlation coefficient for lV(BIA) computed from measurements performed at 155 kHz (i.e. frequency with minimal difference) against lV(MRI) were 6.1% and 0.95 in healthy participants and 9.4% and 0.93 in patients, respectively. Between-day reproducibility of lV(BIA) was as follows: standard error of measurement = 4.6% (95% confidence interval [3.2, 7.8] %), intra-class correlation coefficient = 0.98 (95% confidence interval [0.95, 0.99]). CONCLUSIONS: These findings demonstrate a strong agreement of lean muscle volume estimated using S(BIA) against quantitative MRI in humans, including in patients with severe muscle wasting and fatty degeneration. S(BIA) shows promises for non-invasive, fast, and accessible estimation and follow-up of lean regional skeletal muscle volume for transversal and longitudinal studies.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Inclusion body myositis is the most frequent myositis in patients older than 50 years. Classical immunosuppressants are ineffective in treating inclusion body myositis, and to date there are no recommendations for pharmacological approaches to treatment. When used after organ transplantation, sirolimus can block the proliferation of effector T cells, while preserving T regulatory cells, and induce autophagy, all of which are processes that are impaired in inclusion body myositis. In this pilot study, we aimed to test the efficacy of sirolimus in patients with inclusion body myositis. METHODS: This randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, proof-of-concept, phase 2b trial was done at a single hospital in Paris, France. The study included men and women (aged 45-80 years) who had a defined diagnosis of inclusion body myositis according to established criteria. Eligible participants were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive once-daily oral sirolimus 2 mg or placebo. Centralised balanced block randomisation (blocks of four) was computer generated without stratification. The study comprised a 15-day screening period (days -15 to 0) and a 52-week treatment period (day 0 to month 12). The primary endpoint was the relative percentage change from baseline to month 12 in maximal voluntary isometric knee extension strength. Secondary endpoints included the following assessments at months 6 and 12: 6-min walking distance, isometric muscle strength for hand grip (finger flexors), knee flexion and elbow flexion and extension, forced vital capacity, muscle replacement with fat measured by quantitative nuclear MRI, Inclusion Body Myositis Weakness Composite Index (IBMWCI), Inclusion Body Myositis Functional Rating Scale (IBMFRS), Health Assessment Questionnaire without Disability Index (HAQ-DI), and analyses of T-cell subpopulations by mass cytometry. The primary analysis was done on the intention-to-treat population. The trial is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT02481453. FINDINGS: Between July 15, 2015, and May 13, 2016, we screened 285 patients, 44 of whom were randomly allocated to sirolimus (22 patients) or placebo (22 patients). We observed no difference in the primary outcome of relative percentage change from baseline to month 12 of the maximal voluntary isometric knee extension strength (median difference 3.78, 95% CI -10.61 to 17.31; p=0.85). For secondary outcomes, differences between the groups were not significant for changes in strength of other muscle groups (grip, elbow flexion and extension, or knee flexion), IBMWCI, IBMFRS, and lower limb muscle fat fraction. However, we observed significant differences in favour of sirolimus between the study groups for HAQ-DI, forced vital capacity, thigh fat fraction, and 6-min walking distance. Ten (45%) of 22 patients in the sirolimus group had a serious adverse event compared with six (27%) of 22 patients in the placebo group. Four (18%) patients in the sirolimus group stopped their treatment because of adverse events (severe mouth ulcers, aseptic pneumonia, renal insufficiency, and peripheral lower limb oedema), which resolved after treatment discontinuation. Canker sores were the most frequent side-effect and were mainly mild or moderate in ten patients. INTERPRETATION: We found no evidence for efficacy of sirolimus for treating inclusion body myositis based on maximal voluntary isometric knee extension strength and other muscle strength measures, and the side-effects of treatment were substantial for some patients. However, we believe there was enough evidence of benefit in certain secondary outcomes to pursue a multicentre phase 3 trial to further assess the safety and efficacy of sirolimus.

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Muscle weakness and fatigability, the prominent symptoms of autoimmune myasthenia gravis (MG), negatively impact daily function and quality of life (QoL). It is currently unclear as to what extent symptoms limit activity and whether physical activity (PA) behaviours are associated with reduced QoL. OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to describe habitual PA patterns and explore relationships between PA metrics, clinical MG characteristics, and health-related QoL (HRQoL). METHODS: PA data from a tri-axial trunk accelerometer worn for seven days, was collected from females with generalized, stable MG and compared to control subjects. MG-specific evaluations, the six-minute walk test and knee extension strength were assessed in individuals with MG (IwMG). Mann-Whitney tests were used to study between-group differences. Spearman rank correlation coefficient was performed to explore relationships between variables. RESULTS: Thirty-three IwMG (mean (SD) age 45 (11) years) and 66 control subjects were included. IwMG perform less vigorous-intensity PA than control subjects (p = 0.001), spend more time sedentary (p = 0.02) and engage in less and shorter durations of moderate-vigorous-intensity PA (MVPA). For IwMG, habitual PA correlated positively with 6 min walking distance (rho = 0.387, p = 0.029) and negatively with body mass index (rho = -0.407, p = 0.019). We did not find any association between PA or sedentary behaviour and; HRQoL, symptom severity nor lower limb strength. CONCLUSIONS: Individuals with stable MG perform less PA, at lower intensities, and are more inactive than control individuals. Further research is warranted to understand factors influencing PA patterns in MG and whether interventions could be successful in increasing PA quantity and intensity in IwMG.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Fibromyalgia (FM) is a chronic painful condition partly due to alterations in pain modulation by the central nervous system. Multicomponent therapy (MT) and repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) have both been reported as pain modulators in patients with FM. The aim of this study was to compare the effects of rTMS on pain with a combination of MT and rTMS versus MT alone. METHODS: Thirty-nine FM patients with visual analog scale (VAS) results for pain of >/=40 mm were randomized to active or sham rTMS (high-frequency, primary motor cortex M1) plus 12 weeks of MT (3 sessions per week combining aerobic training, pool-based exercises, and relaxation). Repetitive TMS was started 2 weeks prior to MT and maintained until the end of the program (week 14). Assessments were achieved at baseline, at week 14, and at 6 months (week 40) after completion of the program. The main criterion was pain reduction, as assessed by the weekly mean self-reported level of pain (reported daily). Secondary outcomes were cardiorespiratory fitness (graded maximal exercise test), cardiac autonomic adaptations, and FM impact (using scales for FM impact, depression, sleep efficiency, and pain catastrophizing). RESULTS: The reduction of the weekly mean of pain reported daily did not differ significantly between groups (using repeated measures of analysis of variance [ANOVA]). Two-way ANOVAs showed that pain VAS results, as well as cardiorespiratory fitness, quality of life, depression, and catastrophizing, improved significantly at week 14 and remained stable until week 40. Neither cardiac autonomic adaptations nor sleep efficiency changed significantly. CONCLUSION: Repetitive TMS did not reduce pain in patients with FM who followed the MT program.},

Originally, muscle biopsy was considered as the gold standard for IIM diagnosis. The development of muscle imaging led to revisiting not only the IIM diagnosis strategy but also the patients' follow-up. Different techniques have been tested or are in development for IIM including positron emission tomography, ultrasound imaging, ultrasound shear wave elastography, though magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) remains the most widely used technique in routine. Whereas guidelines on muscle imaging in myositis are lacking here we reviewed the relevance of muscle imaging for both diagnosis and myositis patients' follow-up. We propose recommendations about when and how to perform MRI on myositis patients, and we describe new techniques that are under development.},

   abstract = {Fibrosis is a key pathological feature in muscle disorders, but its quantification mainly relies on histological and biochemical assays. Muscle fibrosis most frequently is entangled with other pathological processes, as cell membrane lesions, inflammation, necrosis, regeneration, or fatty infiltration, making in vivo assessment difficult. Here, we (1) describe a novel mouse model with variable levels of induced skeletal muscle fibrosis displaying minimal inflammation and no fat infiltration, and (2) report how fibrosis affects non-invasive metrics derived from nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and ultrasound shear-wave elastography (SWE) associated with a passive biomechanical assay. Our findings show that collagen fraction correlates with multiple non-invasive metrics. Among them, muscle stiffness as measured by SWE, T(2), and extracellular volume (ECV) as measured by NMR have the strongest correlations with histology. We also report that combining metrics in a multi-modality index allowed better discrimination between fibrotic and normal skeletal muscles. This study demonstrates that skeletal muscle fibrosis leads to alterations that can be assessed in vivo with multiple imaging parameters. Furthermore, combining NMR and SWE passive biomechanical assay improves the non-invasive evaluation of skeletal muscle fibrosis and may allow disentangling it from co-occurring pathological alterations in more complex scenarios, such as muscular dystrophies.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: The relationship between the diaphragm thickening fraction and the transdiaphragmatic pressure, the reference method to evaluate the diaphragm function, has not been clearly established. This study investigated the global and intraindividual relationship between the thickening fraction of the diaphragm and the transdiaphragmatic pressure. The authors hypothesized that the diaphragm thickening fraction would be positively and significantly correlated to the transdiaphragmatic pressure, in both healthy participants and ventilated patients. METHODS: Fourteen healthy individuals and 25 mechanically ventilated patients (enrolled in two previous physiologic investigations) participated in the current study. The zone of apposition of the right hemidiaphragm was imaged simultaneously to transdiaphragmatic pressure recording within different breathing conditions, i.e., external inspiratory threshold loading in healthy individuals and various pressure support settings in patients. A blinded offline breath-by-breath analysis synchronously computed the changes in transdiaphragmatic pressure, the diaphragm pressure-time product, and diaphragm thickening fraction. Global and intraindividual relationships between variables were assessed. RESULTS: In healthy subjects, both changes in transdiaphragmatic pressure and diaphragm pressure-time product were moderately correlated to diaphragm thickening fraction (repeated measures correlation = 0.40, P < 0.0001; and repeated measures correlation = 0.38, P < 0.0001, respectively). In mechanically ventilated patients, changes in transdiaphragmatic pressure and thickening fraction were weakly correlated (repeated measures correlation = 0.11, P = 0.008), while diaphragm pressure-time product and thickening fraction were not (repeated measures correlation = 0.04, P = 0.396). Individually, changes in transdiaphragmatic pressure and thickening fraction were significantly correlated in 8 of 14 healthy subjects (rho = 0.30 to 0.85, all P < 0.05) and in 2 of 25 mechanically ventilated patients (rho = 0.47 to 0.64, all P < 0.05). Diaphragm pressure-time product and thickening fraction correlated in 8 of 14 healthy subjects (rho = 0.41 to 0.82, all P < 0.02) and in 2 of 25 mechanically ventilated patients (rho = 0.63 to 0.66, all P < 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: Overall, diaphragm function as assessed with transdiaphragmatic pressure was weakly related to diaphragm thickening fraction. The diaphragm thickening fraction should not be used in healthy subjects or ventilated patients when changes in diaphragm function are evaluated.},

   abstract = {INTRODUCTION AND OBJECTIVES: Dyspnea is associated with fear and intense suffering and is often assessed using visual analog scales (VAS) or numerical rating scales (NRS). However, the physiological correlates of such ratings are not well known. Using the voluntary breath-holding model of induced dyspnea, we studied healthy volunteers to investigate the temporal relationship between dyspnea, the neural drive to breathe assessed in terms of involuntary thoracoabdominal movements (ITMs) and neurovegetative responses. PARTICIPANTS AND METHODS: Twenty-three participants (10 men; median [interquartile range] age 21 [20-21]) performed three consecutive breath-holds with the continuous assessment of dyspnea (urge-to-breathe) using a 10 cm VAS, thoracic and abdominal circumferences measured with piezoelectric belt-mounted transducers, heart rate and heart rate variability (HRV), and galvanic skin response (GSR). Urge-to-breathe VAS at the onset of ITMs (gasping point) was identified visually or algorithmically. RESULTS: Urge-to-breathe VAS at the end of the breath-hold was 9.7 [8.6-10] cm. Total breath-hold duration was 93 [69-130] s. Urge-to-breathe VAS, ITM, heart rate, HRV, and GSR significantly increased during breath-hold. Urge-to-breathe VAS correlated with the magnitude of the thoracic and abdominal movements (rho = 0.51 and rho = 0.59, respectively, p < 0.001). The urge-to-breathe ratings corresponding with ITM onset were 3.0 [2.0-4.7] cm and 3.0 [1.0-4.0] cm for visual and algorithmic detection, respectively (p = 0.782). CONCLUSION: An urge-to-breathe VAS of 3 cm (30% of full scale on a 10 cm VAS) corresponds to a physiological turning point during the physiological response to voluntary breath-holding in healthy humans.},

   abstract = {Abstract Limited knowledge exists regarding the chronic effect of muscular exercise on muscle function in a murine model of severe Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD). Here we determined the effects of 1 month of voluntary wheel running (WR), 1 month of enforced treadmill running (TR) and 1 month of mechanical overloading resulting from the removal of the synergic muscles (OVL) in mice lacking both dystrophin and desmin (DKO). Additionally, we examined the effect of activin receptor administration (AR). DKO mice, displaying severe muscle weakness, atrophy and greater susceptibility to contraction-induced functional loss, were exercised or treated with AR at 1 month of age and in situ force production of lower leg muscle was measured at the age of 2 months. We found that TR and OVL increased absolute maximal force and the rate of force development of the plantaris muscle in DKO mice. In contrast, those of the tibialis anterior (TA) muscle remained unaffected by TR and WR. Furthermore, the effects of TR and OVL on plantaris muscle function in DKO mice closely resembled those in mdx mice, a less severe murine DMD model. AR also improved absolute maximal force and the rate of force development of the TA muscle in DKO mice. In conclusion, exercise training improved plantaris muscle weakness in severely affected dystrophic mice. Consequently, these preclinical results may contribute to fostering further investigations aimed at assessing the potential benefits of exercise for DMD patients, particularly resistance training involving a low number of intense muscle contractions. Key points Very little is known about the effects of exercise training in a murine model of severe Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD). One reason is that it is feared that chronic muscular exercise, particularly that involving intense muscle contractions, could exacerbate the disease. In DKO mice lacking both dystrophin and desmin, characterized by severe lower leg muscle weakness, atrophy and fragility in comparison to the less severe DMD mdx model, we found that enforced treadmill running improved absolute maximal force of the plantaris muscle, while that of tibialis anterior muscle remained unaffected by both enforced treadmill and voluntary wheel running. Furthermore, mechanical overloading, a non-physiological model of chronic resistance exercise, reversed plantaris muscle weakness. Consequently, our findings may have the potential to alleviate concerns and pave the way for exploring the prescription of endurance and resistance training as a viable therapeutic approach for the treatment of dystrophic patients. Additionally, such interventions may serve in mitigating the pathophysiological mechanisms induced by physical inactivity.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Finding sensitive clinical outcome measures has become crucial in natural history studies and therapeutic trials of neuromuscular disorders. Here, we focus on 1-year longitudinal data from quantitative magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and phosphorus magnetic resonance spectroscopy ((31)P MRS) in a placebo-controlled study of sirolimus for inclusion body myositis (IBM), also examining their links to functional, strength, and clinical parameters in lower limb muscles. METHODS: Quantitative MRI and (31)P MRS data were collected at 3 T from a single site, involving 44 patients (22 on placebo, 22 on sirolimus) at baseline and year-1, and 21 healthy controls. Assessments included fat fraction (FF), contractile cross-sectional area (cCSA), and water T(2) in global leg and thigh segments, muscle groups, individual muscles, as well as (31)P MRS indices in quadriceps or triceps surae. Analyses covered patient-control comparisons, annual change assessments via standard t-tests and linear mixed models, calculation of standardized response means (SRM), and exploration of correlations between MRI, (31)P MRS, functional, strength, and clinical parameters. RESULTS: The quadriceps and gastrocnemius medialis muscles had the highest FF values, displaying notable heterogeneity and asymmetry, particularly in the quadriceps. In the placebo group, the median 1-year FF increase in the quadriceps was 3.2% (P < 0.001), whereas in the sirolimus group, it was 0.7% (P = 0.033). Both groups experienced a significant decrease in cCSA in the quadriceps after 1 year (P < 0.001), with median changes of 12.6% for the placebo group and 5.5% for the sirolimus group. Differences in FF and cCSA changes between the two groups were significant (P < 0.001). SRM values for FF and cCSA were 1.3 and 1.4 in the placebo group and 0.5 and 0.8 in the sirolimus group, respectively. Water T(2) values were highest in the quadriceps muscles of both groups, significantly exceeding control values in both groups (P < 0.001) and were higher in the placebo group than in the sirolimus group. After treatment, water T(2) increased significantly only in the sirolimus group's quadriceps (P < 0.01). Multiple (31)P MRS indices were abnormal in patients compared to controls and remained unchanged after treatment. Significant correlations were identified between baseline water T(2) and FF at baseline and the change in FF (P < 0.001). Additionally, significant correlations were observed between FF, cCSA, water T(2), and functional and strength outcome measures. CONCLUSIONS: This study has demonstrated that quantitative MRI/(31)P MRS can discern measurable differences between placebo and sirolimus-treated IBM patients, offering promise for future therapeutic trials in idiopathic inflammatory myopathies such as IBM.},
