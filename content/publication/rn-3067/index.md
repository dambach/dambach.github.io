abstract: 'KEY POINTS: Twitch transdiaphragmatic pressure elicited by cervical magnetic
  stimulation of the phrenic nerves is a fully non-volitional method for assessing
  diaphragm contractility in humans, yet it requires invasive procedures such as oesophageal
  and gastric catheter balloons. Ultrafast ultrasound enables a very high frame rate
  allowing the capture of transient events, such as muscle contraction elicited by
  nerve stimulation (twitch). Whether indices derived from ultrafast ultrasound can
  be used as an alternative to the invasive measurement of twitch transdiaphragmatic
  pressure is unknown. Our findings demonstrate that maximal diaphragm tissue velocity
  assessed using ultrafast ultrasound following cervical magnetic stimulation is reliable,
  sensitive to change in cervical magnetic stimulation intensity, and correlates to
  twitch transdiaphragmatic pressure. This approach provides a novel fully non-invasive
  and non-volitional tool for the assessment of diaphragm contractility in humans.
  ABSTRACT: Measuring twitch transdiaphragmatic pressure (P(di,tw) ) elicited by cervical
  magnetic stimulation (CMS) is considered as a reference method for the standardized
  evaluation of diaphragm function. Yet, the measurement of P(di) requires invasive
  oesophageal and gastric catheter-balloons. Ultrafast ultrasound is a non-invasive
  imaging technique enabling frame rates high enough to capture transient events such
  as evoked muscle contractions. This study investigated relationships between indices
  derived from ultrafast ultrasound and P(di,tw) , and how these indices might be
  used to estimate P(di,tw) . CMS was performed in 13 healthy volunteers from 30%
  to 100% of maximal stimulator intensity in units of 10% in a randomized order. P(di,tw)
  was measured and the right hemidiaphragm was imaged using a custom ultrafast ultrasound
  sequence with 1 kHz framerate. Maximal diaphragm axial velocity (V(di) ,(max) )
  and diaphragm thickening fraction (TF(di,tw) ) were computed. Intra-session reliability
  was assessed. Repeated-measures correlation (R) and Spearman correlation coefficients
  (rho) were used to assess relationships between variables. Intra-session reliability
  was strong for P(di,tw) and V(di,max) and moderate for TF(di,tw) . V(di,max) correlated
  with P(di,tw) in all subjects (0.64 < rho < 1.00, R = 0.75; all P < 0.05). TF(di,tw)
  correlated with P(di,tw) in eight subjects only (0.85 < rho < 0.93, R = 0.69; all
  P < 0.05). Coupling ultrafast ultrasound and CMS shows promise for the non-invasive
  and fully non-volitional assessment of diaphragm contractility. This approach opens
  up the prospect of both diagnosis and follow-up of diaphragm contractility in clinical
  populations.'
