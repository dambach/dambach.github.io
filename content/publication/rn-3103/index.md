abstract: 'BACKGROUND: The availability of non-invasive, accessible, and reliable
  methods for estimating regional skeletal muscle volume is paramount in conditions
  involving primary and/or secondary muscle wasting. This work aimed at (i) optimizing
  serial bioelectrical impedance analysis (S(BIA) ) by computing a conductivity constant
  based on quantitative magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data and (ii) investigating
  the potential of S(BIA) for estimating lean regional thigh muscle volume in patients
  with severe muscle disorders. METHODS: Twenty healthy participants with variable
  body mass index and 20 patients with idiopathic inflammatory myopathies underwent
  quantitative MRI. Anatomical images and fat fraction maps were acquired in thighs.
  After manual muscle segmentation, lean thigh muscle volume (lV(MRI) ) was computed.
  Subsequently, multifrequency (50 to 350 kHz) serial resistance profiles were acquired
  between current skin electrodes (i.e. ankle and hand) and voltage electrodes placed
  on the anterior thigh. In vivo values of the muscle electrical conductivity constant
  were computed using data from S(BIA) and MRI gathered in the right thigh of 10 healthy
  participants. Lean muscle volume (lV(BIA) ) was derived from S(BIA) measurements
  using this newly computed constant. Between-day reproducibility of lV(BIA) was studied
  in six healthy participants. RESULTS: Electrical conductivity constant values ranged
  from 0.82 S/m at 50 kHz to 1.16 S/m at 350 kHz. The absolute percentage difference
  between lV(BIA) and lV(MRI) was greater at frequencies >270 kHz (P < 0.0001). The
  standard error of measurement and the intra-class correlation coefficient for lV(BIA)
  computed from measurements performed at 155 kHz (i.e. frequency with minimal difference)
  against lV(MRI) were 6.1% and 0.95 in healthy participants and 9.4% and 0.93 in
  patients, respectively. Between-day reproducibility of lV(BIA) was as follows: standard
  error of measurement = 4.6% (95% confidence interval [3.2, 7.8] %), intra-class
  correlation coefficient = 0.98 (95% confidence interval [0.95, 0.99]). CONCLUSIONS:
  These findings demonstrate a strong agreement of lean muscle volume estimated using
  S(BIA) against quantitative MRI in humans, including in patients with severe muscle
  wasting and fatty degeneration. S(BIA) shows promises for non-invasive, fast, and
  accessible estimation and follow-up of lean regional skeletal muscle volume for
  transversal and longitudinal studies.'
