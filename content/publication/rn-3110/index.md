abstract: Although idiopathic inflammatory myopathies (IIM) are a heterogeneous group
  of diseases nearly all patients display muscle inflammation. Originally, muscle
  biopsy was considered as the gold standard for IIM diagnosis. The development of
  muscle imaging led to revisiting not only the IIM diagnosis strategy but also the
  patients' follow-up. Different techniques have been tested or are in development
  for IIM including positron emission tomography, ultrasound imaging, ultrasound shear
  wave elastography, though magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) remains the most widely
  used technique in routine. Whereas guidelines on muscle imaging in myositis are
  lacking here we reviewed the relevance of muscle imaging for both diagnosis and
  myositis patients' follow-up. We propose recommendations about when and how to perform
  MRI on myositis patients, and we describe new techniques that are under development.
