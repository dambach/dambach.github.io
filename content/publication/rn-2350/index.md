abstract: 'This study evaluated gait using lower-trunk accelerometry and investigated
  relationships between gait abnormalities, postural instability, handgrip myotonia,
  and weakness in lower-limb and axial muscle groups commonly affected in myotonic
  dystrophy type 1 (DM1). Twenty-two patients (11 men, 11 women; age = 42 years (range:
  26-51)) with DM1 and twenty healthy controls (9 men, 11 women; age = 44 years (range:
  24-50)) participated in this study. Gait analysis using lower-trunk accelerometry
  was performed at self-selected walking pace. Postural stability was measured via
  center of pressure displacement analysis using a force platform during eyes-closed
  normal stance. Handgrip myotonia was quantified using force-relaxation curve modeling.
  Patients displayed lower walking speed, stride frequency, stride length, gait regularity,
  and gait symmetry. Strength of ankle plantar flexors, ankle dorsal flexors and neck
  flexors correlated with interstride regularity in the vertical direction (rho =
  0.57, rho = 0.59, and rho = 0.44, respectively; all P < 0.05). Knee extension strength
  correlated with gait symmetry in the anteroposterior direction (rho = 0.45, P <
  0.05). Center of pressure velocity was greater in patients and correlated with neck
  flexion and ankle plantar flexion weakness (rho = -0.51 and rho = -0.62, respectively;
  both P < 0.05), and with interstride regularity in the vertical direction (rho =
  -0.58, P < 0.05). No correlation was found between handgrip myotonia and any other
  variable studied. Lower-trunk accelerometry allows the characterization of gait
  pattern abnormalities in patients with DM1. Further studies are required to determine
  the relevance of systematic gait analysis using lower-trunk accelerometry for patient
  follow-up and intervention planning.'
