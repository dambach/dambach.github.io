abstract: Fibrosis is a key pathological feature in muscle disorders, but its quantification
  mainly relies on histological and biochemical assays. Muscle fibrosis most frequently
  is entangled with other pathological processes, as cell membrane lesions, inflammation,
  necrosis, regeneration, or fatty infiltration, making in vivo assessment difficult.
  Here, we (1) describe a novel mouse model with variable levels of induced skeletal
  muscle fibrosis displaying minimal inflammation and no fat infiltration, and (2)
  report how fibrosis affects non-invasive metrics derived from nuclear magnetic resonance
  (NMR) and ultrasound shear-wave elastography (SWE) associated with a passive biomechanical
  assay. Our findings show that collagen fraction correlates with multiple non-invasive
  metrics. Among them, muscle stiffness as measured by SWE, T(2), and extracellular
  volume (ECV) as measured by NMR have the strongest correlations with histology.
  We also report that combining metrics in a multi-modality index allowed better discrimination
  between fibrotic and normal skeletal muscles. This study demonstrates that skeletal
  muscle fibrosis leads to alterations that can be assessed in vivo with multiple
  imaging parameters. Furthermore, combining NMR and SWE passive biomechanical assay
  improves the non-invasive evaluation of skeletal muscle fibrosis and may allow disentangling
  it from co-occurring pathological alterations in more complex scenarios, such as
  muscular dystrophies.
