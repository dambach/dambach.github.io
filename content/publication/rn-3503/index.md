abstract: 'INTRODUCTION AND OBJECTIVES: Dyspnea is associated with fear and intense
  suffering and is often assessed using visual analog scales (VAS) or numerical rating
  scales (NRS). However, the physiological correlates of such ratings are not well
  known. Using the voluntary breath-holding model of induced dyspnea, we studied healthy
  volunteers to investigate the temporal relationship between dyspnea, the neural
  drive to breathe assessed in terms of involuntary thoracoabdominal movements (ITMs)
  and neurovegetative responses. PARTICIPANTS AND METHODS: Twenty-three participants
  (10 men; median [interquartile range] age 21 [20-21]) performed three consecutive
  breath-holds with the continuous assessment of dyspnea (urge-to-breathe) using a
  10 cm VAS, thoracic and abdominal circumferences measured with piezoelectric belt-mounted
  transducers, heart rate and heart rate variability (HRV), and galvanic skin response
  (GSR). Urge-to-breathe VAS at the onset of ITMs (gasping point) was identified visually
  or algorithmically. RESULTS: Urge-to-breathe VAS at the end of the breath-hold was
  9.7 [8.6-10] cm. Total breath-hold duration was 93 [69-130] s. Urge-to-breathe VAS,
  ITM, heart rate, HRV, and GSR significantly increased during breath-hold. Urge-to-breathe
  VAS correlated with the magnitude of the thoracic and abdominal movements (rho = 0.51
  and rho = 0.59, respectively, p < 0.001). The urge-to-breathe ratings corresponding
  with ITM onset were 3.0 [2.0-4.7] cm and 3.0 [1.0-4.0] cm for visual and algorithmic
  detection, respectively (p = 0.782). CONCLUSION: An urge-to-breathe VAS of 3 cm
  (30% of full scale on a 10 cm VAS) corresponds to a physiological turning point
  during the physiological response to voluntary breath-holding in healthy humans.'
