abstract: 'BACKGROUND: Muscle weakness and fatigability, the prominent symptoms of
  autoimmune myasthenia gravis (MG), negatively impact daily function and quality
  of life (QoL). It is currently unclear as to what extent symptoms limit activity
  and whether physical activity (PA) behaviours are associated with reduced QoL. OBJECTIVES:
  This study aimed to describe habitual PA patterns and explore relationships between
  PA metrics, clinical MG characteristics, and health-related QoL (HRQoL). METHODS:
  PA data from a tri-axial trunk accelerometer worn for seven days, was collected
  from females with generalized, stable MG and compared to control subjects. MG-specific
  evaluations, the six-minute walk test and knee extension strength were assessed
  in individuals with MG (IwMG). Mann-Whitney tests were used to study between-group
  differences. Spearman rank correlation coefficient was performed to explore relationships
  between variables. RESULTS: Thirty-three IwMG (mean (SD) age 45 (11) years) and
  66 control subjects were included. IwMG perform less vigorous-intensity PA than
  control subjects (p = 0.001), spend more time sedentary (p = 0.02) and engage in
  less and shorter durations of moderate-vigorous-intensity PA (MVPA). For IwMG, habitual
  PA correlated positively with 6 min walking distance (rho = 0.387, p = 0.029) and
  negatively with body mass index (rho = -0.407, p = 0.019). We did not find any association
  between PA or sedentary behaviour and; HRQoL, symptom severity nor lower limb strength.
  CONCLUSIONS: Individuals with stable MG perform less PA, at lower intensities, and
  are more inactive than control individuals. Further research is warranted to understand
  factors influencing PA patterns in MG and whether interventions could be successful
  in increasing PA quantity and intensity in IwMG.'
