abstract: 'PURPOSE: The potential ergogenic effects of therapeutic inhaled salbutamol
  doses in endurance athletes have been controversially discussed for decades. We
  hypothesized that salbutamol inhalation may increase peripheral muscle contractility,
  reduce fatigability, and improve force recovery after a localized exercise in endurance
  athletes. METHODS: Eleven healthy, nonasthmatic male athletes with high aerobic
  capacities were recruited to be compared in a double-blinded, randomized crossover
  study of two dose levels of salbutamol (200 and 800 mug) and a placebo administered
  by inhalation before a quadriceps fatigue test. Subjects performed an incremental
  exercise protocol consisting in sets of 10 intermittent isometric contractions starting
  at 20% of maximum voluntary contraction (MVC) with 10% MVC increment until exhaustion.
  Femoral nerve magnetic stimulation was used during and after MVC to evaluate neuromuscular
  fatigue after each set, at task failure, and after 10 and 30 min of recovery. RESULTS:
  Initial MVC and evoked muscular responses were not modified with salbutamol (P >
  0.05). The total number of submaximal contractions until task failure significantly
  differed between treatments (placebo, 72 +/- 7; 200 microg, 78 +/- 8; and 800 microg,
  82 +/- 7; P < 0.01). MVC and evoked muscular responses were similarly reduced with
  all treatments during the fatiguing task (all P > 0.05). Voluntary activation was
  unaffected by the fatiguing task and treatments (P > 0.05). CONCLUSION: Supratherapeutic
  inhaled doses of beta2-agonists increased quadriceps endurance during an incremental
  and localized fatiguing task in healthy endurance-trained athletes without significant
  effect on neuromuscular fatigue. Further studies are needed to clarify the underlying
  mechanisms.'
