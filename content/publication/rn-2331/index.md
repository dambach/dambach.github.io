abstract: Rotator cuff (RC) disease is an extremely common condition associated with
  shoulder pain, reduced functional capacities, and impaired quality of life. It primarily
  involves alterations in tendon health and mechanical properties that can ultimately
  lead to tendon failure. RC tendon tears induce progressive muscle changes that have
  a negative impact on surgical reparability of the RC tendons and clinical outcomes.
  At the same time, a significant base of clinical data suggests a relatively weak
  relationship between RC integrity and clinical presentation, emphasizing the multifactorial
  aspects of RC disease. This review aims to summarize the potential contribution
  of peripheral, spinal, and supraspinal neural factors that may (1) exacerbate structural
  and functional muscle changes induced by tendon tear, (2) compromise the reversal
  of these changes during surgery and rehabilitation, (3) contribute to pain generation
  and persistence of pain, (4) impair shoulder function through reduced proprioception,
  kinematics, and muscle recruitment, and (5) help explain interindividual differences
  and response to treatment. Given the current clinical and scientific interest in
  peripheral nerve injury in the context of RC disease and surgery, we carefully reviewed
  this body of literature with a particular emphasis on suprascapular neuropathy that
  has generated a large number of studies in the past decade. Within this process,
  we highlight the gaps in current knowledge and suggest research avenues for scientists
  and clinicians.
