abstract: "BACKGROUND: Finding sensitive clinical outcome measures has become crucial
  in natural history studies and therapeutic trials of neuromuscular disorders. Here,
  we focus on 1-year longitudinal data from quantitative magnetic resonance imaging
  (MRI) and phosphorus magnetic resonance spectroscopy ((31)P MRS) in a placebo-controlled
  study of sirolimus for inclusion body myositis (IBM), also examining their links
  to functional, strength, and clinical parameters in lower limb muscles. METHODS:
  Quantitative MRI and (31)P MRS data were collected at 3 T from a single site, involving
  44 patients (22 on placebo, 22 on sirolimus) at baseline and year-1, and 21 healthy
  controls. Assessments included fat fraction (FF), contractile cross-sectional area
  (cCSA), and water T(2) in global leg and thigh segments, muscle groups, individual
  muscles, as well as (31)P MRS indices in quadriceps or triceps surae. Analyses covered
  patient-control comparisons, annual change assessments via standard t-tests and
  linear mixed models, calculation of standardized response means (SRM), and exploration
  of correlations between MRI, (31)P MRS, functional, strength, and clinical parameters.
  RESULTS: The quadriceps and gastrocnemius medialis muscles had the highest FF values,
  displaying notable heterogeneity and asymmetry, particularly in the quadriceps.
  In the placebo group, the median 1-year FF increase in the quadriceps was 3.2% (P
  < 0.001), whereas in the sirolimus group, it was 0.7% (P = 0.033). Both groups experienced
  a significant decrease in cCSA in the quadriceps after 1 year (P < 0.001), with
  median changes of 12.6% for the placebo group and 5.5% for the sirolimus group.
  Differences in FF and cCSA changes between the two groups were significant (P <
  0.001). SRM values for FF and cCSA were 1.3 and 1.4 in the placebo group and 0.5
  and 0.8 in the sirolimus group, respectively. Water T(2) values were highest in
  the quadriceps muscles of both groups, significantly exceeding control values in
  both groups (P < 0.001) and were higher in the placebo group than in the sirolimus
  group. After treatment, water T(2) increased significantly only in the sirolimus
  group's quadriceps (P < 0.01). Multiple (31)P MRS indices were abnormal in patients
  compared to controls and remained unchanged after treatment. Significant correlations
  were identified between baseline water T(2) and FF at baseline and the change in
  FF (P < 0.001). Additionally, significant correlations were observed between FF,
  cCSA, water T(2), and functional and strength outcome measures. CONCLUSIONS: This
  study has demonstrated that quantitative MRI/(31)P MRS can discern measurable differences
  between placebo and sirolimus-treated IBM patients, offering promise for future
  therapeutic trials in idiopathic inflammatory myopathies such as IBM."
