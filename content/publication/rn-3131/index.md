abstract: 'BACKGROUND: The relationship between the diaphragm thickening fraction
  and the transdiaphragmatic pressure, the reference method to evaluate the diaphragm
  function, has not been clearly established. This study investigated the global and
  intraindividual relationship between the thickening fraction of the diaphragm and
  the transdiaphragmatic pressure. The authors hypothesized that the diaphragm thickening
  fraction would be positively and significantly correlated to the transdiaphragmatic
  pressure, in both healthy participants and ventilated patients. METHODS: Fourteen
  healthy individuals and 25 mechanically ventilated patients (enrolled in two previous
  physiologic investigations) participated in the current study. The zone of apposition
  of the right hemidiaphragm was imaged simultaneously to transdiaphragmatic pressure
  recording within different breathing conditions, i.e., external inspiratory threshold
  loading in healthy individuals and various pressure support settings in patients.
  A blinded offline breath-by-breath analysis synchronously computed the changes in
  transdiaphragmatic pressure, the diaphragm pressure-time product, and diaphragm
  thickening fraction. Global and intraindividual relationships between variables
  were assessed. RESULTS: In healthy subjects, both changes in transdiaphragmatic
  pressure and diaphragm pressure-time product were moderately correlated to diaphragm
  thickening fraction (repeated measures correlation = 0.40, P < 0.0001; and repeated
  measures correlation = 0.38, P < 0.0001, respectively). In mechanically ventilated
  patients, changes in transdiaphragmatic pressure and thickening fraction were weakly
  correlated (repeated measures correlation = 0.11, P = 0.008), while diaphragm pressure-time
  product and thickening fraction were not (repeated measures correlation = 0.04,
  P = 0.396). Individually, changes in transdiaphragmatic pressure and thickening
  fraction were significantly correlated in 8 of 14 healthy subjects (rho = 0.30 to
  0.85, all P < 0.05) and in 2 of 25 mechanically ventilated patients (rho = 0.47
  to 0.64, all P < 0.05). Diaphragm pressure-time product and thickening fraction
  correlated in 8 of 14 healthy subjects (rho = 0.41 to 0.82, all P < 0.02) and in
  2 of 25 mechanically ventilated patients (rho = 0.63 to 0.66, all P < 0.01). CONCLUSIONS:
  Overall, diaphragm function as assessed with transdiaphragmatic pressure was weakly
  related to diaphragm thickening fraction. The diaphragm thickening fraction should
  not be used in healthy subjects or ventilated patients when changes in diaphragm
  function are evaluated.'
