abstract: Abstract Limited knowledge exists regarding the chronic effect of muscular
  exercise on muscle function in a murine model of severe Duchenne muscular dystrophy
  (DMD). Here we determined the effects of 1 month of voluntary wheel running (WR),
  1 month of enforced treadmill running (TR) and 1 month of mechanical overloading
  resulting from the removal of the synergic muscles (OVL) in mice lacking both dystrophin
  and desmin (DKO). Additionally, we examined the effect of activin receptor administration
  (AR). DKO mice, displaying severe muscle weakness, atrophy and greater susceptibility
  to contraction-induced functional loss, were exercised or treated with AR at 1 month
  of age and in situ force production of lower leg muscle was measured at the age
  of 2 months. We found that TR and OVL increased absolute maximal force and the rate
  of force development of the plantaris muscle in DKO mice. In contrast, those of
  the tibialis anterior (TA) muscle remained unaffected by TR and WR. Furthermore,
  the effects of TR and OVL on plantaris muscle function in DKO mice closely resembled
  those in mdx mice, a less severe murine DMD model. AR also improved absolute maximal
  force and the rate of force development of the TA muscle in DKO mice. In conclusion,
  exercise training improved plantaris muscle weakness in severely affected dystrophic
  mice. Consequently, these preclinical results may contribute to fostering further
  investigations aimed at assessing the potential benefits of exercise for DMD patients,
  particularly resistance training involving a low number of intense muscle contractions.
  Key points Very little is known about the effects of exercise training in a murine
  model of severe Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD). One reason is that it is feared
  that chronic muscular exercise, particularly that involving intense muscle contractions,
  could exacerbate the disease. In DKO mice lacking both dystrophin and desmin, characterized
  by severe lower leg muscle weakness, atrophy and fragility in comparison to the
  less severe DMD mdx model, we found that enforced treadmill running improved absolute
  maximal force of the plantaris muscle, while that of tibialis anterior muscle remained
  unaffected by both enforced treadmill and voluntary wheel running. Furthermore,
  mechanical overloading, a non-physiological model of chronic resistance exercise,
  reversed plantaris muscle weakness. Consequently, our findings may have the potential
  to alleviate concerns and pave the way for exploring the prescription of endurance
  and resistance training as a viable therapeutic approach for the treatment of dystrophic
  patients. Additionally, such interventions may serve in mitigating the pathophysiological
  mechanisms induced by physical inactivity.
