abstract: 'OBJECTIVES: To (i) evaluate the feasibility and the reliability of a test
  assessing quadriceps strength, endurance and fatigue in patients with fascioscapulohumeral
  dystrophy (FSHD) and Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease (CMT), (ii) compare quadriceps
  function between patients and healthy controls. METHODS: Controls performed the
  test once and patients twice on two separate visits. It involved progressive sets
  of 10 isometric contractions each followed by neuromuscular assessments with FNMS.
  RESULTS: Volitional assessment of muscle strength, endurance and fatigue appeared
  to be reliable in FSHD and CMT patients. Supramaximal FNMS was achieved in approximately
  70% of FSHD patients and in no CMT patients. In FSHD patients, Femoral nerve magnetic
  stimulation (FNMS) provided reliable assessment of central (typical error as a coefficient
  of variation (CVTE)<8% for voluntary activation) and peripheral (CVTE<10% and intraclass
  coefficient correlation >0.85 for evoked responses) function. Patients and controls
  had similar reductions in evoked quadriceps responses, voluntary activation and
  similar endurance. CONCLUSIONS: This test provides reliable evaluation but FNMS
  exhibits limitations due to insufficient stimulation intensity particularly in neurogenic
  conditions. It showed similar central and peripheral quadriceps fatigability in
  patients and controls. SIGNIFICANCE: This test may be a valuable tool for patient
  follow-up although further development of magnetic stimulation devices is needed
  to extend its applicability.'
